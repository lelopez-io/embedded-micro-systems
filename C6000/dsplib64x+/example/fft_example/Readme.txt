This example demonstrates the usage of the various FFT kernels provided with the 64x+ DSPLIB. The example shows:
- Twiddle factor generation for the various kernels
- Needed scaling to get correct output
- Demonstrates usage of FFT APIs

The included 'DefaultOutput.JPG' shows the output generated by the example code.
